# C-former
Convolutional Transformer for EEG Emotion Recognition

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of measuring the
electrical impulses produced by the brain when presented a
stimuli and has various applications in clinical settings. In this
paper, we propose C-former a novel transformer based architecture
by incorporating convolutional token embedding layers
and a convolutional feature extractor for the task of emotion
classification using EEG signals. Experimental results
on the benchmark dataset, SEED, show that our proposed approach
outperforms previous models and is competitive with
the state-of-the-art while being more robust to variations in
the data.
